David: Netsino

It’s a fun game to play, but is almost impossible to win. The boss cash starts out with a crazy number, so a normal method would be suboptimal. The source code has the answer. You may notice that the input for the value has a flaw, and a large enough number can result in negative. Losing negative number will result in gaining, so we supply a very large number and choose a very unlikely bet such as the Snake’s Eye, we will eventually gain money from the boss and receive the flag.
